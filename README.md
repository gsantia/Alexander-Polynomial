# Alexander-Polynomial
Math M.S. thesis, titled `Methods for Computation of the Alexander Polynomial`.
Details several different methods for computing the Alexander polynomial
of classical knots. Surveys some essentials of knot theory and builds up to a description of the Alexander
polynomial. It is the result of an independent study in knot theory under the supervision of Professor
John Klein at Wayne State University.
