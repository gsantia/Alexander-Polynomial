# Alexander-Polynomial
The essay I wrote for my Math M.S., titled "Methods for Computation of the Alexander Polynomial",
at Wayne State University. Details several different methods for computing the Alexander polynomial
of classical knots. Surveys the essentials of knot theory and builds up to description of the Alexander
polynomial. It is the result of an independent study in knot theory under the supervision of Professor
John Klein.
